# Taffic Sign Classification using CNN and LSTM

This project focuses on the classification of traffic sign images using CNN and LSTM networks. The objective is to compare the performance of these models in classifying images with text data.

The effectiveness of CNN and LSTM networks are evaluated in this task. The CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94%, while the LSTM model achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 88%.

These results highlight the superior performance of the CNN model in accurately classifying traffic sign images, showcasing its potential for image recognition tasks. The LSTM model, although achieving a slightly lower accuracy, still demonstrates its capability in handling image classification with text data.
